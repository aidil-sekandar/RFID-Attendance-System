GENERAL STEPS:
1. First, you will need to set up a new Firebase project and enable the Firebase Realtime Database.
2. Next, you will need to install the Firebase Arduino library to your Arduino IDE.
3. In the setup function, you will need to establish a connection to the Firebase Realtime Database using the Firebase credentials.
4. In the loop function, you will need to read the RFID tag and check if it matches any of the tags that you have previously registered.
5. If the RFID tag is matched, you will need to record the attendance data to the Firebase Realtime Database.
6. Once the data is recorded, you can use the Firebase Realtime Database to display the attendance data on a website or mobile app.

ARDUINO STEPS:
RFID-based attendance system that
can be stored in Firebase

- Libraries:
1. Firebase Arduino library: This library allows you to connect to the Firebase Realtime Database and perform operations such as read, write, and update data. You can install it from the Arduino library manager.
2. MFRC522 or PN532 library: Depending on the RFID module you are using, you will need to install the corresponding library. These libraries provide the necessary functions to communicate with the RFID module and read the data from the RFID tags.
3. ESP8266WiFi library: This library is required if you're using an ESP8266 board as it provides the necessary functions to connect to WiFi network.
4. ArduinoJson library: This library allows you to parse JSON data, which can be useful if you want to send data to Firebase in JSON format.

Time library: This library is required if you want to record the time of attendance.

- Electronic Parts:
1. Arduino board (e.g. Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega)
2. RFID reader (e.g. MFRC522, PN532)
3. RFID tags or cards
4. Jumper wires
5. Breadboard (Optional)
6. LEDs (Optional, for visual feedback)
7. Connections to power the system (e.g. USB cable, power supply)
8. An ESP8266 based WiFi module (if your arduino board doesn't have built-in WiFi)

- Coding Steps:
1. Gather the necessary components: Arduino board, RFID reader (e.g. MFRC522, PN532), RFID tags or cards, jumper wires, breadboard (optional), LEDs (optional for visual feedback), connections to power the system, a computer with Arduino IDE installed, and a Firebase account.
2. Install the necessary Arduino libraries: Firebase Arduino library, MFRC522 or PN532 library, ESP8266WiFi library and Time library.
3. Set up a new Firebase project and enable the Firebase Realtime Database.
4. Create a new Arduino sketch and include the necessary libraries and pin connections in the sketch.
5. Define the pin connections between the RFID reader and the Arduino board.
6. Initialize the RFID reader by creating an object of the MFRC522 or PN532 library, depending on the module you're using, and passing the pin connections.
7. Connect to your WiFi network by providing the SSID and password of your network and using the ESP8266WiFi library.
8. Initialize the Firebase by providing the credentials like project name, firebase URL and API key.
9. In the loop function, start by calling the RFID reader library's function to detect a card.
10. Once a card is detected, read the unique ID of the card using the RFID reader library's function.
11 Compare the card ID with the registered card IDs, if it matches, then record the attendance data to the Firebase Realtime Database by providing the path of the location where the data needs to be stored, the data and the timestamp.
12. Use the Firebase Realtime Database to display the attendance data on a website or mobile app.
13. Test the system and make any necessary adjustments.
